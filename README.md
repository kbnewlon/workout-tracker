Use this application to view, create and track daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Fitness Tracker 2020 allows the user to be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track the distance traveled.
